# Init

`ohrs` provide some useful subcommand to help us initial and build project.

`init` is a subcommand with `ohrs`, a standard command just be here:

```shell
ohrs init xx
```

Tool will create a folder named `xx`, and it will be also as project's name in `Cargo.toml`. So `Cargo.toml` will be like:

```toml
[package]
name    = "xx"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
```

And the final prebuild binary's name will be `libxx.so`.

::: danger Don't do it
‚ùå Don't use some special name. For example: `test` `crate` `fn` etc.
